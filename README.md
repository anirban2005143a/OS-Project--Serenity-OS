    cd serenity
    ```
2.  **Follow the build instructions** in the repository's README file to set up the required tools and dependencies.
3.  **Build and run SerenityOS** in an emulator such as QEMU or VirtualBox.

## Usage

1.  **Retro Games Emulator:** Choose an emulator like RetroArch or a lightweight alternative[7][8]. Compile it for SerenityOS using its build system[10]. Ensure it integrates with Serenity's GUI and input systems[10]. Test the emulator by running ROMs of retro games[10].
